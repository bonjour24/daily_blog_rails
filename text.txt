methods must always belong to a class (or: be instance methods of some class)
normal methods belong to the class they're defined in (i.e. are instance methods of the class)
class methods are just singleton methods of a Class
singleton methods of an object are not instance methods of the class of the object; rather, they are instance methods of the singleton class of the object.

 
foo = Array.new

def foo.size
  "Hello World!"
end

foo.size  # => "Hello World!"
foo.class # => Array
#Create another instance of Array Class and call size method on it

bar = Array.new
bar.size  # => 0
